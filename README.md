👨‍💻 <b> Computer Science Student | Web Technology Enthusiast | Angular Developer </b>

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Silesian University of Technology. My passion lies in web technologies, and I have hands-on experience building applications with Angular. I'm always eager to learn and grow, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge.

When I'm not coding, you can find me attending various IT events and hackathons, where I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals and tackling new challenges. As a young developer, I'm committed to continuous improvement and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

Let's connect and create something amazing together!
